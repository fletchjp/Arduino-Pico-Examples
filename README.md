# Arduino-Pico-Examples
 
Example code for various RP2040 hardware using the Arduino-Pico system

I have examples which I have put together for a number of different RP2040 systems.

This repository is somewhere to gather them together.

## ArdiPi

This is a board with an Arduino UNO form factor carrying a Raspberry Pi Pico.

I have begun testing this and have a first example working using Arduino-Pico.

The suppliers have put Micropython examples in a repository called ArdiPi_Software which I have forked.

I asked about support for the Arduino-Pico system and have a very dismissive reply so I will keep software for it away from them for now.

I have started to add some examples I have found elsewhere.

## Multicore

This is a test code which comes with the Arduino-Pico system.
