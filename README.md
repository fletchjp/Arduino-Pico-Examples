# Arduino-Pico-Examples
 
Example code for various RP2040 hardware using the Arduino-Pico system

I have examples which I have put together for a number of different RP2040 systems.

This repository is somewhere to gather them together.

I have several different sets of Pico hardware and some of the examples may work on one and not others. 

## ArdiPi

From SB components

This is a board with an Arduino UNO form factor carrying a Raspberry Pi Pico.

I have begun testing this and have a first example working using Arduino-Pico.

The suppliers have put Micropython examples in a repository called ArdiPi_Software which I have forked.

I asked about support for the Arduino-Pico system and have a very dismissive reply so I will keep software for it away from them for now.

I have started to add some examples I have found elsewhere.

## Pico Breadboard

From SB components

I have had this for some time. The pico sits on it.-

## Multicore

This is a test code which comes with the Arduino-Pico system. It should work with anything.

## MulticoreWithBuzz

This extends the Multicore example using the buzzer which is in a fixed location on the ArdiPi.

# CBUS examples

I have also collected some examples of work with RP2040s to run CBUS modules. This is in an early state.

These mostly come from MERG-Arduino-Software/CBUScodes. I have copied them unchanged although they will start to change here.

There is quite a lot to be done here.
